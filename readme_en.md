### Development board ready

1. For the latest [FPGADemo] (https://github.com/DoneSEA/SEA) to add QSPI module, support serial data output.

2. Use [Vivado 2018.3](https://china.xilinx.com) to compile and generate bit files.

3. Move the BIT file into the TF card overlay folder

Arduino programming

1. Burn and write the development board.

2. Use the serial port monitor to observe the original data of the gyroscope.

3. Compile the data processing module to process the original data.

4. Write the counter module for shaking count.
